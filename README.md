this Repository is for caching what is caching and how does it work

## What is Caching?

In computing, a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the dataâ€™s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.

## How does Caching work?

The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM (Random-access memory) and may also be used in correlation with a software component. A cache's primary purpose is to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the need to access the underlying slower storage layer.

Trading off capacity for speed, a cache typically stores a subset of data transiently, in contrast to databases whose data is usually complete and durable.

**if your js file doesn't support the import method just go to the package.json file and add "type":"module"**

## How to node cache

```
import nodeCache from 'node-cache';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const myCache = new nodeCache({stdTTL:10});
const todoURL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos';

if(myCache.has('todos')) {
    return myCache.get('todos')
}else{
    fetch(todoURL)
    .then(res => res.json)
    .then(data => {
        myCache.set('todos',data)
        return data
    })
}

```
